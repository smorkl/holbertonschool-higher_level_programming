# New HBnB V2

This project is a simulation of a rental platform similar to HBnB. In this application, users can:
- Create and manage accounts.
- Create and list amenities.
- Create places.
- Leave reviews for the places they visit.

Data is stored in a database using **SQLAlchemy**, which supports CRUD operations to save and manage users, amenities, places, and reviews.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd hbnb
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure your database environment variables (if applicable) in the `config.py` file.

## Usage

To run the project, open a terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
python3 run.py
```

## Project Architecture

The project follows a three-layer architecture pattern, which helps keep the code organized, scalable, and modular:

- **Presentation Layer (API)**: Manages HTTP requests and responses.
- **Business Logic Layer (Services)**: Handles business logic and coordinates operations between models.
- **Persistence Layer (Repository)**: Interacts with the database to perform storage and retrieval operations.
