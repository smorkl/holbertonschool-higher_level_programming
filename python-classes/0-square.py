"""Square Class

This class represents a square shape.

Currently, it's an empty class, meaning it doesn't
 define any attributes or methods
specific to squares. However, you can extend this class
 to add functionalities
related to squares, such as:

- Calculating area (side_length * side_length)
- Calculating perimeter (4 * side_length)
- Checking if another object is also a square
- Drawing a visual representation of the square
 using ASCII art or other libraries

By adding methods and attributes, you can make this
 class more useful for working
with squares in your Python programs.
